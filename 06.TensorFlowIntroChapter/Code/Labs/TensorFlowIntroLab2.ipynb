    "# TensorFlow Introduction Lab 2  -- Preventing Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "This objective of this second TensorFlow lab is to test methods to help prevent the neural network models from overfitting. This is based on topics covered in Chapter 4 -- Supplemental Training Procedures, which you may want to review before running this lab. In particular, you will test the effects of using batch normalization and early stopping. In addition, you will use **data augmentation**. This is a way of increasing the size of the dataset by adding images that are realistic modifications of the original images. The larger a dataset is, the less likely the network will overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working on this lab, you may find it useful to consult websites related to [tf.data.Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset), which describes all of the methods that can be used with TensorFlow Datasets, and [TensorFlow Input Pipelines](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will use a dataset that is contained in the [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets). The datasets here can be loaded directly into the `tf.data.Datasets` format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another model from keras that we use in this lab is [preprocssing](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/experimental/preprocessing). We will use methods from this library for normalizing and augmenting data.\n",

Add the following argument to the `tfds.load()` method: `split=['train[:85%]', 'train[85%:]', 'test']`. This will return a list of three different Datasets. The first, which will have 85% of the traning set, will be used for training. The second, which will use 15% of the training set, will be used for validation. The third Dataset will contain the test set. The validation set will be passed to the fit method as `validation_data`. The performance on this set will be displayed during training, and saved in `history`, but it will not be used for weight updates. By monitoring the validation set during training, we can identify when the network is overfitting."
